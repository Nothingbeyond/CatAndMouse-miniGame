Interactive games for elementary school students Based on Scratch
(I) Source of the Work:
During the summer vacation, I participated in the "Colorful Information Lets Dreams Fly - TIP Science Popularization Education" summer social practice team organized by the School of Information Engineering at Wuhan University of Technology. We conducted a research study on "The Current State of Youth Programming Education." Our volunteer team collaborated with five community centers to tutor students in completing their homework and provide companionship. Leveraging our professional strengths, we designed courses, conducted trial classes, and ultimately delivered programming science popularization lessons to primary school students in various communities.

(II) My Contributions:

Independently learned to use the Scratch software to create interactive games for elementary school students based on graphical programming principles. This involved programming using simple text-based graphical modules to introduce game programming.
Wrote teaching plans, detailing every step of the programming design process.
Formed a team to design experimental class plans related to our field of study.
Completed and wrote a social practice research report and press release to further promote the results of our practice, exemplify the team's typical effects, and encourage more college youth to participate in such volunteer service activities.
